#### Features:

- Connect to a minecraft server as a client (offline mode only)
- Supports zlib packet compression
- Login sequence and Keep Alive packet exchange
 
#### Goals:

For the current version:
- Support all server/client bound packets
- Microsoft Account Authentication
- Server implementation

#### Long Term:

If the project reaches a certain stage in development, I might consider working on some of these features:
- Protocol support for the latest version
- Backwards compatibility from 1.8.9 to latest version
