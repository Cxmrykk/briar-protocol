## Briar Protocol
**Currently supporting minecraft `1.8.9`**

#### Features:

- Connect to a minecraft server as a client (offline mode only)
- Supports zlib packet compression
- Login sequence and Keep-Alive packet exchange
 
#### Goals:

For the current version:
- Microsoft Account Authentication
- Packet Encryption
- Server implementation

#### Deriving Projects:

If the project matures enough, I might consider working on:
- Packet sniffer using the client/server implementation
- Higher level client library

#### Long Term:

If the project reaches a certain stage in development, I might consider working on some of these features:
- Protocol support for the latest version
