      <p>Experimental WIP Minecraft protocol project<br>
      (Legacy support: 1.8.9)</p>

#### Features:

- Connect to a 1.8.9 Server as a client (offline mode only)
- Supports zlib packet compression
- Login sequence and Keep Alive packet exchange
 
#### Goals:

- Support all packets (1.8.9)
- Microsoft Account Authentication (Client)
- Server implementation

#### Long Term:

If the project reaches a certain stage in development, I might begin working on some of these goals:
- Protocol support for the latest version, and backwards compatibility
- Superset projects (Full client or server implementation, for example)
