#### Features:

- Connect to a 1.8.9 Server as a client (offline mode only)
- Supports zlib packet compression
- Login sequence and Keep Alive packet exchange
 
#### Goals:
For version 1.8.9:
- Support all server/client bound packets
- Microsoft Account Authentication
- Server implementation

#### Long Term:

If the project reaches a certain stage in development, I might consider working on some of these features:
- Protocol support for the latest version, and backwards compatibility
- Superset projects (Full client or server implementation, for example)

#### FAQ
```
Why version 1.8.9 and not the latest version?
- Simpler and therefore much easier to get initially working
- Still used on popular servers (Hypixel, for example)
- Unsupported for the majority of client libraries

Although if still interested in the future, I may consider working towards supporting other versions.
