## Briar Protocol

**Currently supporting minecraft `1.8.9`**

#### Features:

- Connect to a minecraft server as a client
- Zlib packet compression and AES encryption
- Login sequence and Keep-Alive packet exchange
- Microsoft authentication (refresh token supported)

#### Goals:

For the current version:

- Event handler using channels
- Server implementation

#### Deriving Projects:

If the project matures enough, I might consider working on:

- Packet sniffer using the client/server implementation
- High level client library

#### Long Term:

Potential features for future consideration include:

- Protocol support for the latest version
